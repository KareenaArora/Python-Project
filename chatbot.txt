Agriculture
Agriculture is the process of producing food, feed, fiber and many other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals (livestock). The practice of agriculture is also known as "farming", while scientists, inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture.


Nomadic Herding
Nomadic herding is based upon the rearing of animals on natural pastures This practice is performed by the people of semi-arid and arid regions These people stay on the move with their animals in search of natural pastures for their livestock to graze The type of animals reared differ from one region to the other Northern Africa, parts of Arabia and parts of northern Eurasia are the typical regions of this type of farming This is a subsistence type of activity.

Shifting Cultivation
This type of farming is most often adopted in the tropics Under this system, the land is obtained by clearing forest areas using a slash and burn technique The land is then cultivated for a few years, or until the fertility declines or the land is overtaken by the weeds and other native flora At this point, farmers move on to clear another area of the forest This is a subsistence type of farming that is almost always done manually This type of agriculture is usually adopted by people living in tropical regions like southeast Asia, with a major emphasis is on grain crops This type of farming is declining due to pressure by environmentalists.


Rudimentary Sedentary Tillage
This is a subsistence type of agriculture and it differs from the aforementioned types because the same plot of land is cultivated continuously year after year Fallowing of land is commonly adopted to maintain soil fertility, and is a technique often adopted in tropical regions Besides grain crops, some tree crops such as the Pará rubber tree are grown using this system.


Intensive Subsistence Farming with Rice Dominant
This is practiced in tropical regions that have high populations and receive a large amount of precipitation Rice is the dominant crop when it comes to this type of farming, as it can employ and feed a large number of people per unit of area The southeast Asian region is where most of this type of farming is done This type of farming requires the use of both manual and animal power, and farmers try to enhance the productivity per unit of area with the use of manures.


Commercial Plantations
Although practiced over a rather small area, this type of farming is quite important in terms of its commercial value The major products of this type of farming are tropical crops such as tea, coffee, rubber and palm oil This type of farming has developed in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America where the colonial influence of Europeans has remained Most of the plantations were developed to provide tropical crops to the European markets This is a highly capital-intensive type of farming and most of the crops are tree crops.


Mediterranean Agriculture
The typically rugged terrain of the Mediterranean region has resulted in typical livestock and crop combinations Wheat, vineyards and citrus fruits are the major crops, and small animals are the major livestock reared in the region Horticulture is a major activity of this region, and most of the crops are grown during the winter with the help of winter rains.


Commercial Grain Farming
This type of farming is a response to farm mechanization and is the major type of farming in the areas with low rainfall and population These crops are prone to the vagaries of weather and droughts, and monoculture of wheat is the general practice Prairies, steppes, and temperate grasslands of South America and Australia are the main areas for this type of farming.


Livestock and Grain Farming
This type of agriculture is commonly known as mixed farming, and originated in the humid areas of the middle latitudes, except Asia Its development is closely related to the market facilities, and it is a typically European type of farming Great Britain and New Zealand are examples of areas where this type of farming is common practice.


Subsistence Crop and Stock Farming
In this type of agriculture practically nothing is sold off the farm This type of farming has been common in areas of middle latitudes with lower fertility of soils, or in areas with rough terrain It has declined significantly after the collectivization of farming in Russia, which was one of the major regions where this was practiced.


Dairy Farming
This type of farming also had its origin in Europe, from where it spread to other areas Close proximity to the market and a temperate climate are the two favorable factors which have been responsible for the development of this type of farming Countries like Denmark and Sweden have witnessed the maximum development of this type of farming.


Specialized Horticulture
This type of farming has developed to take advantage of a large demand for horticulture products, especially in areas of large-scale urbanisation and high-density population It has been most successful when used for vineyard cultivation in areas of France, northern Hungary and the Swiss Lakes regions Although Whittlesey's agricultural classification is quite elaborate, the regionalisation on the basis of this classification is not something permanent Due to changing market demands and developing agricultural technology, a number of changes have come into the agricultural pattern of the world since Whittlesey's study Large demands for fruits and vegetables in the urban areas have resulted in modified land use in many parts of the world, and such factors impart a dynamic character to the agricultural activity.


Pesticide
Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests, including weeds The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators, termiticides, etc) nematicide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, and fungicide The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects In general, a pesticide is a chemical[vague] or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, or fungus) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors Along with these benefits, pesticides also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.


Global Warming
Global warming is a term used for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects Scientists are more than 95% certain that nearly all of global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other human-caused emissions Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation Increasing or decreasing amounts of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.


Farming
Farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials.


Food
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.


Crop
A crop is a plant or animal product that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence Crop may refer either to the harvested parts or to the harvest in a more refined state Most crops are cultivated in agriculture or aquaculture A crop may include macroscopic fungus (e.g. mushrooms), or alga Most crops are harvested as food for humans or fodder for livestock Some crops are gathered from the wild.


Weed Removal
Weed Removal is the botanical component of pest control, which attempts to stop weeds, especially noxious weeds, from competing with desired flora and fauna including domesticated plants and livestock, and in natural settings preventing non native species competing with native species Weed removal is important in agriculture Methods include hand cultivation with hoes, powered cultivation with cultivators, smothering with mulch, lethal wilting with high heat, burning, and chemical control with herbicides (weed killers).


Fertilizer
A fertilizer (American English) or fertiliser (British English; see spelling differences) is any material of natural or synthetic origin (other than liming materials) that is applied to soil or to plant tissues to supply one or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants Many sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced.


Fencing
Fencing is a group of three related combat sports The three disciplines in modern fencing are the foil, the épée, and the sabre (also saber); winning points are made through the weapon's contact with an opponent A fourth discipline, singlestick, appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian system There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.


Ranching
Ranching is the practice of raising herds of animals on large tracts of land Ranchers commonly raise grazing animals such as cattle and sheep Some ranchers also raise elk, bison, ostriches, emus, and alpacas The ranching and livestock industry is growing faster than any other agricultural sector in the world.


Plantation
A plantation is a large farm which is specialized on farming one type of crop Plantations grow cash crops, mostly for export, and less for local use Crops grown on plantations include banana, sugarcane, coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco.


Maize
Maize (called corn in some countries) is Zea mays, a member of the grass family Poaceae It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans Most is used to make corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.


Wheat
Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat.


Rice
Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.


Cotton
Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae The fiber is almost pure cellulose Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.


Sugarcane
Sugarcane, or sugar cane, or simply cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, used for sugar production The plant is two to six metres (six to twenty feet) tall It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops It is native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.


Drought
A drought or drouth is an event of prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric (below-average precipitation), surface water or ground water A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.


Grain
A grain is a small, hard, dry seed, with or without an attached hull or fruit layer, harvested for human or animal consumption A grain crop is a grain-producing plant The two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes.


Barley
Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.


Soyabean
The soybean or soya bean (Glycine max) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, from which tofu and tofu skin are made Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto, and tempeh Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.


Millet
Millets are a group of highly variable small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food Millets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa (especially in India, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger), with 97% of millet production in developing countries The crop is favored due to its productivity and short growing season under dry, high-temperature conditions Millets are indigenous to many parts of the world The most widely grown millet is pearl millet, which is an important crop in India and parts of Africa Finger millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet are also important crop species.


Potato
The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself, a perennial in the family Solanaceae Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.


Coconut
The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only known living species of the genus Cocos The term "coconut" (or the archaic "cocoanut") can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco, meaning 'head' or 'skull' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses, ranging from food to cosmetics The inner flesh of the mature seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid, called coconut water or coconut juice.


Rye
Rye (Secale cereale) is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus Hordeum) and wheat (Triticum) Rye grain is used for flour, bread, beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.


Pest
A pest is any animal or plant detrimental to humans or human concerns, including crops, livestock and forestry, among others The term is also used of organisms that cause a nuisance, such as in the home An older usage is of a deadly epidemic disease, specifically plague In its broadest sense, a pest is a competitor of humanity.
